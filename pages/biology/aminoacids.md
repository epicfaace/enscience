##Proline
<img class="small" src="/images/proline.png">

***Proline*** is especially rigid because its side chain is attached to the protein backbone twice. So, it can introduce kinks in alpha helices -- it is known as a ***"helix-breaker."***

It is most commonly found in the first or second positions of alpha helices (creates kinks if found further).
