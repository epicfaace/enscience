##Types of Chromosomes

###Lampbrush chromosomes
***Lampbrush chromosomes*** are formed at the end of oogenesis (when meiosis produces egg cells) in all animals except for mammals.

They are meiotic half-bivalent -- basically, a pair of homologous chromosomes that is split in two. They contain ***chromomeres*** (condensed parts of DNA), from which asymmetric ***loops*** extend.

The loops are the location of active RNA transcription. They help in rapid development and growth of the egg.

###Polytene chromosomes
***Polytene chromosomes*** are extra-large chromosomes. They are found in the salivary glands of **Drosophila**, and contain characteristic light and dark bands.

Polytene chromosomes are formed through ***endomitosis***, in which DNA replicates, skipping the mechanism of mitosis isself. They form in organs that need to undergo rapid growth.

Many times, many polytene chromosomes join their centromeres to form a common ***chromocenter***:

####Types of polyteny

In ***classical polyteny***, all chromatids conjugate (join together) perfectly (a).

In ***cryptic polyteny***, chromatid conjugation is only partial (b).

If only one pair of chromatids is connected, "pompon-like" chromosomes form (c).
