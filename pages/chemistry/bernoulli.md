###Venturi effect

The ***Venturi effect*** is the drop of fluid pressure when a fluid flows through a constricted section of pipe -- velocity increases, so static pressure decreases. Also known as ***Bernoulli's principle***.

###Stagnation pressure
Take a fluid initially flowing at velocity $$v_1$$ at point 1. At Point $$P_2$$, the fluid has nowhere to go, so it's stagnant (does not move).

$$V_2 = 0$$ because fluid is stagnant, and assume height diff. is negligible. Then by Bernoulli's equation:

$$P_2 = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 + P_1$$

$$P_2$$ is known as the ***stagnation pressure***.

####Pitot tubes
***Pitot tubes*** make use of stagnation pressure to measure velocity. When stag. pressure and P1 and measured, you can calculate v (velocity).
