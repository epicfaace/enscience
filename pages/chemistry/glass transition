##Introduction
The ***glass transition temperature*** is the temperature at which amorphous substances turn from a rubber-like state to a glass (a brittle, hard state).

###Kauzmann's paradox
Kauzmann's paradox states that if you supercool a liquid below Tg, then eventually at low enough temperatures, you can extrapolate that the entropy difference between the supercooled liquid and the glass will be 0.

It is paradoxical that a liquid could have the same entropy as a solid! To resolve this, Kauzmann proposed that below the ***Kauzmann temperature*** (Tk), there would be no distinction between the supercooled liquid and the glass. Others have proposed a second "glass transition temperature" between the supercooled liquid and the glass phase.
