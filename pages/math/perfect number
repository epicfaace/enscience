##Definition
A ***perfect number*** is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors – that is, all its factors excluding the number itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its proper factors are 1, 2, and 3:

$$6 = 3 + 2 + 1$$

###List of first few perfect numbers
* 6
* 28
* 496
* 8128

It is not known if any odd perfect numbers exist.

##Euclid-Euler Theorem (Mersenne Primes)
The ***Euclid–Euler theorem*** says that every even perfect number can be written in the form:

$$2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$$

when p is prime. $$2^p - 1$$ is also known as a ***Mersenne prime***. Therefore, there is a one-to-one relationship between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes. Using the formula, all perfect numbers can be generated from Mersenne primes, and vice versa.

###Binary representation
When a Mersenne prime is equal to $$2^p - 1$$, its binary representation is just $$p$$ 1's. For example, $$2^5 - 1 = 11111$$ in binary.

Since a perfect number is just a Mersenne prime times 2^(k-1), it adds $$k-1$$ zeroes to the end of the number. So the binary representation of a perfect number $$2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$$ is $$p$$ 1's followed by $$p-1$$ zeroes.

For example, $$496 = 2^4*(2^5-1) = 111110000$$ in binary (5 ones followed by 4 zeroes).
