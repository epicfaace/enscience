##Introduction
A ***pulsar*** is a rotating neutron star that emits radiation at a regular frequency.

##Period of a pulsar
The period of a pulsar is the time between pulses it emits. Periods are typically a few seconds long and are very regular. However, periods usually get longer over long periods of time, as the pulsar loses energy and begins to slow down.

###Glitches
Sometimes pulsars suddenly speed up or slow down, changing their periods. They are thought to be caused by ***starquakes***. Starquakes occur in neutron stars when their crust suddenly shifts, like an earthquake on Earth.

###Millisecond pulsars
Pulsars are divided into two types: millisecond and ordinary. A ***millisecond pulsar*** has a period of only a few milliseconds.

##Discovery
Pulsars were discovered by Jocelyn Hewish and Anthony Bell, who observed pulses of radio waves. They initially dubbed them ***LGM***s (for "Little Green Men"), as they thought aliens could be sending these waves. They received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.

##How pulsars work
Pulsars are thought to be rotating neutron stars. They can be described by the ***"lighthouse model"*** -- radiation is emitted from the poles, which "sweeps" through space as the pulsar rotates.

##Notable examples

###Crab pulsar
The Crab Nebula contains a pulsar in its center.

###Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar

The ***Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar*** displayed a slow increase in its period, which was shown to be caused by gravitational waves, thus confirming a key part of the theory of general relativity.
