##Introduction
A ***pulsar*** is a rotating neutron star that emits radiation at a regular frequency.

##Period of a pulsar
The period of a pulsar is the time between pulses it emits. Periods are typically a few seconds long and are very regular. However, periods usually get longer over long periods of time, as the pulsar loses energy and begins to slow down.

###Glitches
Sometimes pulsars suddenly speed up or slow down, drastically changing their periods. They are thought to be caused by ***starquakes***. Starquakes occur in neutron stars when their crust suddenly shifts, like an earthquake on Earth.

###Millisecond pulsars
Pulsars are divided into two types: millisecond and ordinary. A ***millisecond pulsar*** has a period of only a few milliseconds.

##Discovery
Pulsars were discovered by Jocelyn Hewish and Anthony Bell, who observed pulses of radio waves. They initially dubbed them ***LGM***s (for "Little Green Men"), as they thought aliens could be sending these waves. They received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.

##How pulsars work
Pulsars are thought to be rotating neutron stars. They can be described by the ***"lighthouse model"*** -- radiation is emitted from the poles, which "sweeps" through space as the pulsar rotates.

##Notable examples

###Crab pulsar

The Crab Nebula contains a pulsar in its center.

###Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar

The ***Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar*** was the first binary pulsar to be observed. Measurements confirmed that it has a slow decrease in its period. This decrease provided evidence for the existence of ***gravitational waves***, thus confirming a key part of the theory of general relativity.

####Gravitational waves
***Gravitational waves*** are radiation caused by massive objects that move around in spacetime. They are predicted by the theory of general relativity. As stars in a binary system emit gravitational waves, they lose energy, so they move closer together and faster, causing the period to decrease.

Gravitational waves have not been directly observed yet. ***LIGO*** (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) is an ongoing experiment that aims to detect gravitational waves.
