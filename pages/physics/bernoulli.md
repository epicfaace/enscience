##Introduction

***Bernoulli's equation*** -- based on conservation of energy:

##Venturi effect

The ***Venturi effect*** is the drop of fluid pressure when a fluid flows through a constricted section of pipe -- velocity increases, so static pressure decreases.

A version of the Venturi effect that applies to air is commonly known as ***Bernoulli's principle***.

##Stagnation pressure
Take a fluid initially flowing at velocity $$v_1$$ at point 1. At Point $$P_2$$, the fluid has nowhere to go, so it's stagnant (does not move).

$$V_2 = 0$$ because fluid is stagnant, and assume height diff. is negligible. Then by Bernoulli's equation:

$$P_2 = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 + P_1$$

$$P_2$$ is known as the ***stagnation pressure***.

###Pitot tubes
***Pitot tubes*** make use of stagnation pressure to measure velocity. When stagnation pressure and $$P_1$$ are measured, you can calculate the initial velocity (v).
