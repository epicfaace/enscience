##Faraday effect
When linearly polarized light is passed through a magnetic field parallel to it, the plane of polarization is rotated. This is known as the ***Faraday effect*** or ***Faraday rotation***. It is one example of magneto-optic phenomena.

###Solids/liquids - Verdet constant
The ***Verdet constant*** is a constant that quantifies the strength of the Faraday effect for a certain material -- the constant of proportionality between the angle of rotation and magnetic field.

$$\theta = \nu Bd$$

where $$\nu$$ is the Verdet constant, $$B$$ is the magnetic flux density, and $$d$$ is the length of the path in which the fields interact.

###Interstellar medium
The Faraday Effect is caused when light travels through the interstellar medium and encounters free electrons.

$$\theta = RM \lambda ^2$$

This time, the angle is proportional to the square of the wavelength. RM is known as the ***rotation measure*** and characterizes the effect's strength.
