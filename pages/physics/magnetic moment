##Introduction and definition
The ***magnetic moment*** $$\mu$$ defines the torque that an object experiences in a magnetic field.

$$\tau = \mu \times \textbf{B}$$

The torque (torque exerted by the magnetic force) is equal to the cross product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

###Formula

<img src="/images/solenoid.png" style="small"><br>
A ***solenoid*** is a coil of wire that produces a magnetic field when an electric current is passed through it. The magnetic moment is defined as the current times the area times N (number of loops):

$$\mu = NIA$$

##Potential energy
The potential energy is defined as the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field:

$$U = - \mu B$$
